## Research Focus Areas

For EACH article, extract:

### 1. Core Patterns & Principles
- Agent design philosophy
- Orchestration mechanisms
- Tool use patterns
- Context engineering techniques
- Quality gates and validation
- Error handling and resilience

### 2. Architectural Decisions
- Why certain approaches were chosen
- Trade-offs discussed
- Performance considerations
- Scalability patterns

### 3. Best Practices
- Agent coordination strategies
- Multi-agent systems design
- Self-correction mechanisms
- Testing and validation approaches
- Documentation standards

### 4. Revolutionary Terminology
- What unique terms does Anthropic use?
- How do they describe their orchestration layer?
- What metaphors or frameworks do they employ?
- Is there a unifying concept for agentic systems?

### 5. Integration Patterns
- MCP server architecture
- Plugin systems
- Hook mechanisms
- Extension points
- Tool composition

### 6. Quality & Safety
- How do they ensure reliability?
- What quality gates exist?
- Error recovery strategies
- Monitoring and observability

## Context: Our Current System

We have:
- **Skills**: research-methodology, planning-methodology, quality-validation, pattern-recognition
- **Commands**: /workflow, /research, /plan, /implement
- **Agents**: chief-architect, docs-researcher, implementation-planner, code-implementer
- **Integration**: VAMFI Brahma system (18 agents, build-fix-serve workflows)

We need to understand:
1. What is the proper revolutionary term for what we're building?
2. How do Anthropic's patterns enhance our implementation?
3. What gaps exist between our system and their philosophy?

## Research Strategy

1. Start with main blog: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering
2. Use WebSearch for each article title
3. Fetch full content (not summaries)
4. Extract actionable patterns
5. Focus on official Anthropic sources only

## Success Criteria

✅ All 11 articles fetched and analyzed
✅ Revolutionary term identified
✅ Patterns categorized and synthesized
✅ Clear application roadmap to our system
✅ Authoritative sources documented
