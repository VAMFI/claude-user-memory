## 🚀 Key Innovations Implemented

### 1. Official Agent Format
**What**: All 4 agents converted to Claude Code official format
**Why**: Native integration, better performance, official support
**Impact**: Agents now work seamlessly with Claude Code v2.0+ features

**Agents**:
- ✅ `chief-architect.md` - Master orchestrator
- ✅ `docs-researcher.md` - Rapid research specialist
- ✅ `implementation-planner.md` - Strategic architect
- ✅ `code-implementer.md` - Precision executor with 3-retry self-correction

### 2. Skills System (BRAND NEW - Oct 16, 2025)
**What**: 4 model-invoked methodology skills
**Why**: Claude automatically applies best practices without explicit prompting
**Impact**: Consistent quality, automatic expertise application

**Skills**:
- ✅ `research-methodology` - How to research (truth over speed)
- ✅ `planning-methodology` - How to plan (minimal changes, reversibility)
- ✅ `quality-validation` - How to validate (objective scoring rubrics)
- ✅ `pattern-recognition` - How to learn (automatic knowledge capture)

### 3. Deterministic Hooks (Quality Gates)
**What**: Bash scripts that enforce workflow phases
**Why**: Hooks always run (not LLM-dependent) - 100% reliable
**Impact**: Cannot skip research/plan phases, quality guaranteed

**Hooks**:
- ✅ **PreToolUse**: `validate-research-pack.sh` - Blocks planning without research
- ✅ **PreToolUse**: `validate-implementation-plan.sh` - Blocks coding without plan
- ✅ **PostToolUse**: `auto-format.sh` - Ensures consistent code style
- ✅ **PostToolUse**: `run-tests.sh` - Validates implementation (disabled by default)
- ✅ **Stop**: `update-knowledge-core.sh` - Captures patterns automatically

## 🎯 Quality Gate Scores

### ResearchPack Validation
**Passing Score**: 80/100

**Criteria (100 points total)**:
- Completeness (40 pts): Library, APIs, setup, examples
- Accuracy (30 pts): API signatures, versions, official sources
- Citation (20 pts): Source URLs, confidence, references
- Actionability (10 pts): Checklist, open questions

**Enforcement**: PreToolUse hook before @implementation-planner runs

### Implementation Plan Validation
**Passing Score**: 85/100 (higher bar)

**Criteria (100 points total)**:
- Completeness (35 pts): Files, steps, verification, tests
- Safety (30 pts): Rollback plan, risk assessment, minimal changes
- Clarity (20 pts): Actionable steps, success criteria, time estimates
- Alignment (15 pts): Matches ResearchPack, addresses requirements

**Enforcement**: PreToolUse hook before @code-implementer runs

## 🔧 How to Use the New System

### Method 1: Complete Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
# Start with chief-architect for complex tasks
@chief-architect "Add Redis caching to product service with TTL configuration"

# Chief-architect will:
# 1. Invoke @docs-researcher (triggers research-methodology skill)
#    → ResearchPack validated by hook (must score 80+)
# 2. Invoke @implementation-planner (triggers planning-methodology skill)
#    → Plan validated by hook (must score 85+)
# 3. Invoke @code-implementer (triggers quality-validation skill)
#    → Self-corrects up to 3 times if tests fail
# 4. Capture patterns via pattern-recognition skill
#    → update-knowledge-core.sh hook updates knowledge-core.md
```

### Method 2: Direct Agent Invocation

```bash
# For research only
@docs-researcher "Redis caching for Node.js"
# → Output: ResearchPack (validated by hook)

# For planning only (requires ResearchPack)
@implementation-planner "Create Redis caching plan"
# → Hook checks ResearchPack exists and scores 80+
# → Output: Implementation Plan (validated by hook)

# For implementation only (requires both ResearchPack + Plan)
@code-implementer "Execute Redis caching plan"
# → Hook checks Plan exists and scores 85+
# → Implements with 3-retry self-correction
```

### Method 3: Skills Auto-Activation

Skills activate automatically when relevant:
- **research-methodology**: Activates when documentation needed
- **planning-methodology**: Activates when creating plans
- **quality-validation**: Activates when validating outputs
- **pattern-recognition**: Activates after successful implementations

You don't invoke skills directly - Claude uses them automatically!

- ✅ Model-invoked (Claude decides when to use)
- ✅ Comprehensive methodologies documented

### Hooks
- ✅ All 5 hooks executable (`chmod +x`)
- ✅ Validation scripts with scoring rubrics
- ✅ Auto-format for multiple languages
- ✅ Knowledge core auto-update on session end
- ✅ settings.json configured with hook mappings

### Integration

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test the validation hooks:

```bash
# Test ResearchPack validation
./.claude/hooks/validate-research-pack.sh
# Expected: Warns if no recent ResearchPack found

# Test Plan validation
./.claude/hooks/validate-implementation-plan.sh
# Expected: Warns if no recent Plan found

# Test knowledge core update
./.claude/hooks/update-knowledge-core.sh
# Expected: Creates or updates knowledge-core.md
```

### Test the workflow:

1. **Create a test ResearchPack** (in project root):
   ```markdown
   # ResearchPack: Test Library

   Target Library: test-lib v1.0.0

   ### API: testFunction()
   Source: https://test-lib.com/docs

   Confidence: HIGH
   ```

2. **Run validation**:
   ```bash
   ./.claude/hooks/validate-research-pack.sh
   ```
   Should score and pass/fail based on completeness
