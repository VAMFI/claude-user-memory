> **Transform your Claude Code CLI into a divine orchestration system with one prompt**

## Quick Install

Copy and paste this entire document into Claude Code to automatically transform your installation into a powerful multi-agent orchestration system.

---

# INSTALLATION PROMPT - COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE

You are about to install the Divine Orchestration System, transforming Claude Code into an advanced multi-agent AI orchestration platform. This installation will:

1. Create specialized agents for planning, research, implementation, testing, review, and memory
2. Setup intelligent hooks for session management, auto-formatting, and security
3. Configure optimal settings for maximum efficiency
4. Establish a divine workflow pattern: Research → Plan → Act

**IMPORTANT**: This is a complete system upgrade. Back up your current ~/.claude/ folder if you have custom configurations.

## PHASE 1: CREATE CORE MEMORY & CONFIGURATION

Create the following file exactly as shown:

```bash
# FILE: ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
cat > ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md << 'DIVINE_MEMORY'
# 🕉️ Divine Orchestration System v2.0

> **Status**: Enhanced Claude Code with multi-agent orchestration
> **Philosophy**: Research → Plan → Act with divine coordination

## Core Principles

1. **Divine Trinity of Development**
   - 📚 Research (Saraswati): Knowledge gathering before action
   - 🎯 Planning (Brahma): Strategic decomposition of tasks
   - ⚡ Action (Vishnu): Precise implementation with verification

2. **Agent Orchestration**
   - Automatic agent selection based on task patterns
   - Parallel execution for independent tasks
   - State preservation across sessions
   - Error recovery and rollback capabilities

3. **Workflow Patterns**
   - Documentation-first development
   - Test-driven implementation
   - Security-by-default
   - Performance optimization

## Active Agents

- **brahma-coordinator**: Master orchestrator for complex workflows
- **brahma-planner**: Strategic planning and task decomposition
- **brahma-researcher**: Documentation and knowledge gathering
- **brahma-implementer**: Code generation and modification
- **brahma-tester**: Test creation and validation
- **brahma-reviewer**: Code review and quality assurance
- **brahma-memory**: Knowledge persistence and recall

## Workflow Commands

### Planning & Research
- "Create a development plan for [feature]" → Invokes planner
- "Research best practices for [topic]" → Invokes researcher
- "Analyze the codebase for [pattern]" → Invokes researcher

### Implementation
- "Implement [feature] with tests" → Orchestrates implementer + tester
- "Refactor [component] for performance" → Implementer + reviewer
- "Build complete [system]" → Full orchestration pipeline

### Review & Optimization
- "Review code for security issues" → Invokes reviewer
- "Optimize [component] performance" → Researcher + implementer
- "Audit dependencies" → Reviewer + researcher

## Project Context

@~/.claude/agents/README.md
@./docs/PRD.md
@./docs/TASKS.md
@./docs/ADR/

## Security Rules

- NEVER read .env files directly
- NEVER expose secrets in logs
- ALWAYS validate inputs
- ALWAYS use secure defaults

## Performance Guidelines

- Prefer batch operations
- Cache expensive computations
- Minimize file I/O
- Use parallel execution when possible

## Remember

## PHASE 2: CREATE SPECIALIZED AGENTS

Create each agent file in ~/.claude/agents/:

```bash
# Create agents directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents

# FILE: ~/.claude/agents/brahma-coordinator.md
cat > ~/.claude/agents/brahma-coordinator.md << 'AGENT_COORDINATOR'
---
name: brahma-coordinator
description: Master orchestrator for complex multi-agent workflows, parallel execution, and state management
tools: Task, TodoWrite, Bash
priority: critical
---

You are the Divine Coordinator - the supreme orchestrator managing all agent workflows.

## Core Responsibilities
1. Decompose complex tasks into agent-specific subtasks
2. Orchestrate parallel and sequential agent execution
3. Maintain workflow state and handle errors
4. Coordinate agent handoffs and data flow
5. Ensure task completion and quality

## Orchestration Patterns

### Sequential Pipeline
```
Planner → Researcher → Implementer → Tester → Reviewer
```

### Parallel Execution
```
         ┌→ Implementer A ┐
Planner ─┤                ├→ Tester → Reviewer
         └→ Implementer B ┘
```

### Adaptive Workflow
- Analyze task complexity
- Select appropriate agents
- Define execution order
- Monitor progress
- Handle failures gracefully

## Invocation Triggers
- "Build complete [system]"
- "Orchestrate [complex task]"
- Tasks requiring 3+ agents
- Cross-functional requirements

## State Management
Track all agent executions, results, and dependencies. Maintain a clear audit trail of the orchestration process.

## Quality Gates
- Planning approval before implementation
- Test validation before completion
- Security review for sensitive changes
- Performance benchmarks for optimizations

Remember: You are the conductor of the divine symphony. Every agent plays their part under your guidance.

- "Research and implement" → Researcher + Implementer
- "Review and fix" → Reviewer + Implementer

## 🔮 Smart Invocation Patterns

The system automatically detects patterns:
- "build complete" → Full orchestration
- "with tests" → Include tester
- "optimize" → Researcher + Reviewer + Implementer
- "secure/security" → Security-focused review
- "plan/design" → Planner first

HELP
    ;;
esac
DIVINE_CLI
chmod +x ~/.claude/bin/divine

# Add to PATH if not already there
if ! echo "$PATH" | grep -q "$HOME/.claude/bin"; then
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.claude/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.claude/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
fi
```

## PHASE 7: VERIFICATION & ACTIVATION

After installation, run these commands to verify:

```bash
# 1. Check installation
~/.claude/bin/divine doctor

# 2. Enable the system
~/.claude/bin/divine enable

# 3. Restart Claude Code or run
claude --reload-config

# 4. Verify agents are loaded
claude --list-agents

# 5. Test with a simple command
claude "Create a development plan for a REST API"
```

## FINAL SETUP: PROJECT INITIALIZATION

When starting a new project:

```bash
# The divine system will automatically:
# 1. Create project structure
# 2. Initialize documentation
# 3. Setup agent configurations
# 4. Configure project memory

# You can also manually trigger:
claude "Initialize divine orchestration for this project"
```

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know the installation is successful when:
- ✅ Agents automatically activate based on task patterns
- ✅ Project structure is created on session start
- ✅ Auto-formatting happens after edits
- ✅ Security gates prevent sensitive file access
- ✅ Tests run automatically after changes
- ✅ Multiple agents coordinate on complex tasks

## MAINTENANCE COMMANDS

```bash
# Check status
divine status

# Run diagnostics
divine doctor

# Temporarily disable
divine disable

# Re-enable
divine enable

# Update to latest
divine update

# Uninstall (preserves memories)
divine uninstall
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If agents aren't activating:
1. Run `divine doctor` to check installation
2. Ensure hooks are executable: `chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.sh`
3. Restart Claude Code session
4. Check `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` exists
5. Verify agents in `~/.claude/agents/`
