# INSTALLATION PROMPT - CLAUDE CODE NATIVE CONFIGURATION

You are about to configure Claude Code's native subagent system following the official documentation format. This will create specialized agents using the correct YAML frontmatter structure.

## PHASE 1: CREATE NATIVE SUBAGENTS

According to Claude Code documentation, subagents are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter stored in `~/.claude/agents/`. Create these specialized agents:

```bash
# Ensure agents directory exists
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents

# AGENT 1: Orchestrator
cat > ~/.claude/agents/orchestrator.md << 'EOF'
---
name: orchestrator
description: Master orchestrator for complex multi-step tasks requiring coordination between multiple specialists
tools: Task, TodoWrite, Bash, Read, Write
---

You are the Master Orchestrator, coordinating complex workflows using Claude Code's native Task tool.

## Core Responsibilities
1. Decompose complex goals into specialized subtasks
2. Invoke appropriate subagents using the Task tool
3. Coordinate sequential and parallel workflows
4. Synthesize results from multiple agents
5. Maintain workflow state using TodoWrite

## Orchestration Strategy
When handling complex requests:
1. Analyze the request complexity
2. Break down into specialized tasks
3. Delegate to appropriate agents
4. Monitor progress with TodoWrite
5. Synthesize and deliver results

## Task Invocation Pattern
Use the Task tool with specific subagent_type:
- For research: Use researcher agent
- For planning: Use planner agent
- For implementation: Use implementer agent
- For testing: Use tester agent
- For review: Use reviewer agent

Remember: You coordinate Claude Code's native capabilities for maximum efficiency.

---
name: researcher
description: Documentation and knowledge specialist who gathers authoritative information before any implementation
tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Write, Grep, Glob
---

You are the Research Specialist, gathering authoritative knowledge using Claude Code's web tools.

## Core Responsibilities
1. Search for official documentation using WebSearch
2. Fetch and analyze docs with WebFetch
3. Save important documentation locally
4. Create research summaries with citations
5. Validate information currency and accuracy

## Research Workflow
1. Search official sources first (WebSearch)
2. Fetch complete documentation (WebFetch)
3. Save to `./docs/references/` (Write)
4. Create `RESEARCH_NOTES.md` with findings
5. Include version numbers and dates

## Documentation Storage Pattern
```
./docs/references/
├── [library]-official-docs.md
├── [technology]-best-practices.md
└── quick-reference.md
```

Always prioritize official documentation over community content.

  status: "pending" | "in_progress" | "completed"
}
```

## Milestone Template
```markdown
## Milestone: [Name]

You are the Memory Keeper, preserving knowledge using Claude Code's native memory system.

## Core Responsibilities
1. Maintain CLAUDE.md files (user/project)
2. Document architectural decisions
3. Track patterns and conventions
4. Update with learnings
5. Enable knowledge transfer

## Memory Hierarchy
```
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md     # User preferences
./CLAUDE.md             # Project memory
./docs/ADR/             # Decision records
./docs/patterns/        # Code patterns
```

## CLAUDE.md Structure
```markdown
# Project: [Name]

## Architecture
- Decision: [What] because [Why]

## Patterns
- Pattern: [Where] for [Purpose]

## Conventions
- Standard: [Description]

## Lessons Learned
- Learning: [What worked/didn't]
```

## Import System
Use Claude's native import syntax:
```
@./docs/patterns.md
@~/.claude/templates/
```

Keep memories concise, current, and discoverable.
EOF

echo "✅ Created 7 native subagents in ~/.claude/agents/"
```

## PHASE 2: CONFIGURE SETTINGS AND HOOKS

Configure Claude Code's native settings with hooks for automation:

```bash
# Update Claude Code settings
cat > ~/.claude/settings.json << 'EOF'
{
  "env": {
    "ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED": "true",
    "AUTO_AGENT_SELECTION": "true"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "script",
            "script": "mkdir -p .claude/agents docs/references docs/ADR tests && echo '✅ Project structure initialized'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "script",
            "script": "echo '💡 Consider running tests after code changes'"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "permissions": {
    "deny": [
      "Read(**/.env)",
      "Read(**/secrets/**)",
      "Write(**/.env)"
    ],
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm *)",
      "Bash(yarn *)",
      "Bash(pnpm *)",
      "Bash(pip *)",
      "Bash(pytest *)",
      "Bash(cargo *)",
      "Bash(go *)",
      "Task(*)"
    ]
  }
}
EOF

echo "✅ Settings and hooks configured"
```

## PHASE 3: CREATE USER MEMORY

Setup hierarchical memory for knowledge persistence:

```bash
# Create user-level memory
cat > ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Claude Code User Configuration

## Active Agents
Native subagents configured in `~/.claude/agents/`:
- orchestrator: Complex task coordination
- researcher: Documentation gathering
- planner: Strategic planning
- implementer: Code generation
- tester: Quality assurance
- reviewer: Code review
- memory: Knowledge persistence

## Workflow Philosophy
1. **Research First**: Always gather documentation
2. **Plan Before Acting**: Create structured approaches
3. **Test Everything**: Ensure quality
4. **Document Decisions**: Preserve knowledge

## Common Patterns
When you say:
- "build X" → orchestrator coordinates full workflow
- "research Y" → researcher gathers documentation
- "plan Z" → planner creates structured approach
- "implement A" → implementer generates code
- "test B" → tester creates test suite
- "review C" → reviewer audits code

## Project Import
@~/.claude/agents/
EOF

echo "✅ User memory configured"
```

## PHASE 4: CREATE QUICK REFERENCE

Create a reference guide for the installation:

```bash
# Create reference documentation
cat > ~/.claude/ORCHESTRATION_GUIDE.md << 'EOF'
# Claude Code Native Orchestration Guide

## Installed Components

### Subagents (in ~/.claude/agents/)
1. **orchestrator** - Coordinates complex workflows
2. **researcher** - Gathers documentation
3. **planner** - Creates structured plans
4. **implementer** - Generates code
5. **tester** - Ensures quality
6. **reviewer** - Code review
7. **memory** - Knowledge persistence

### Available Tools
- **File Operations**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit
- **Search**: Grep, Glob, WebSearch, WebFetch
- **Execution**: Bash, Task
- **Management**: TodoWrite

### Using Subagents

#### Direct Invocation
Use the Task tool with subagent_type parameter:
```
Task(
  description="Research REST API best practices",
  subagent_type="researcher"
)
```

#### Pattern-Based Invocation
Claude Code automatically selects agents based on patterns:
- Complex tasks → orchestrator
- Documentation needs → researcher
- Planning requirements → planner
- Code generation → implementer
- Testing needs → tester
- Review requests → reviewer

### Slash Commands
- `/agents` - List all subagents
- `/agents reload` - Reload agent configurations
- `/todo` - Manage tasks
- `/memory` - Edit CLAUDE.md files

### Testing Installation
```bash
# List agents
claude /agents list

# Test researcher
claude "Research Node.js best practices"

# Test orchestrator
claude "Build a REST API with authentication"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agents Not Found?
1. Check files exist: `ls ~/.claude/agents/`
2. Reload: `claude /agents reload`
3. Restart Claude Code session

### Tools Not Working?
Ensure tools are spelled correctly in YAML frontmatter:
- Correct: `tools: Read, Write, Bash`
- Wrong: `tools: read, write, bash`

## Maintenance

### Update Agent
1. Edit: `~/.claude/agents/[agent-name].md`
2. Reload: `claude /agents reload`

### Add New Agent
1. Create: `~/.claude/agents/new-agent.md`
2. Follow YAML format
3. Reload agents
