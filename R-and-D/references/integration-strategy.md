# Integration Strategy: Official Claude Code Features → claude-user-memory
**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Purpose**: Align claude-user-memory with official Claude Code capabilities
**Status**: Strategic Planning

---

## Executive Summary

Research reveals that Claude Code v2.0+ includes extensive built-in features that overlap with claude-user-memory's goals. This document provides a strategic path to:

1. **Leverage** official features instead of duplicating them
2. **Enhance** built-in capabilities with structured workflows
3. **Integrate** seamlessly with the official ecosystem
4. **Distribute** as an official Claude Code plugin

**Key Finding**: claude-user-memory should be a **workflow orchestration layer** built on official primitives, not a replacement for them.

### Phase 2: Implement Hooks for Quality Gates (Week 2)

**2.1 Create Hooks Configuration**
```json
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "name": "Validate Research Before Planning",
        "matcher": "implementation-planner",
        "command": "validate-research-pack.sh"
      },
      {
        "name": "Validate Plan Before Implementation",
        "matcher": "code-implementer",
        "command": "validate-implementation-plan.sh"
      },
      {
        "name": "Prevent Direct Implementation",

        "command": "check-workflow-phase.sh"
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "name": "Auto-format After Write",
        "matcher": "Write",
        "command": "auto-format.sh {{file}}"
      },
      {
        "name": "Run Tests After Code Changes",
        "matcher": "Write",
        "command": "run-tests.sh {{file}}"
      }
    ],

      {
        "name": "Update Knowledge Core",
        "matcher": "*",
        "command": "update-knowledge-core.sh"
      }
    ],
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "name": "Generate Session Summary",
        "matcher": "*",
        "command": "generate-summary.sh"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**2.2 Create Hook Scripts**
```bash
# .claude/hooks/validate-research-pack.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Ensure ResearchPack exists before planning

if [ ! -f "docs/references/research-pack.md" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: No ResearchPack found. Run docs-researcher first."
  exit 1
fi

# Validate ResearchPack structure
# [validation logic]
```

### Phase 3: Package as Official Plugin (Week 3)

**3.1 Create Plugin Structure**
```bash
claude-user-memory/

│   └── plugin.json             # Plugin metadata
├── agents/
│   ├── chief-architect.md
│   ├── docs-researcher.md
│   ├── implementation-planner.md
│   └── code-implementer.md
├── skills/
│   ├── research-methodology/
│   ├── planning-methodology/
│   ├── quality-validation/
│   └── pattern-recognition/
├── commands/
│   ├── research.md             # /research command
│   ├── plan.md                 # /plan command
│   ├── implement.md            # /implement command
│   └── workflow.md             # /workflow command
