# Claude Code Plugin Distribution Strategy - Complete Research Report

**Research Date**: October 17, 2025
**Research Focus**: Official and community best practices for distributing Claude Code plugins/agents to the public
**Sources**: Official Anthropic documentation, GitHub repositories, community marketplaces

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Findings

1. **OFFICIAL METHOD**: GitHub-based plugin marketplaces with `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (launched October 2025)
2. **EASIEST INSTALLATION**: Single command: `/plugin marketplace add user/repo` then `/plugin install plugin-name`
3. **MOST DISCOVERABLE**: GitHub topics, awesome lists, and official marketplace listings
4. **NO PACKAGE MANAGERS**: Claude Code plugins are NOT distributed via npm or PyPI (only CLI itself uses npm)
5. **FASTEST TO MARKET**: GitHub repository + marketplace.json = instant distribution

### Recommended Primary Distribution Method

**GitHub-Based Plugin Marketplace** - This is the official, recommended, and most widely adopted approach.

## Part 1: Official Claude Code Plugin System

### 1.1 What Are Claude Code Plugins?

Plugins are custom collections that can include:
- **Slash commands**: Custom shortcuts for frequently-used operations
- **Subagents**: Purpose-built agents for specialized tasks
- **MCP servers**: Connections to tools and data sources
- **Hooks**: Customize Claude Code behavior at key workflow points

### 1.2 Official Plugin Marketplace System

**Launched**: October 2025 (Public Beta)
**Status**: Fully operational, rapidly growing ecosystem

**How It Works**:
1. Developer creates a GitHub repository
2. Adds `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` to repository root
3. Users add marketplace with one command
4. Users browse and install plugins via `/plugin` menu

### 1.3 Marketplace.json Format

```json
{
  "name": "my-marketplace",
  "owner": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "you@example.com",
    "url": "https://yoursite.com"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "Description of your marketplace",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "pluginRoot": "./plugins"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "plugin-name",
      "description": "Plugin description",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "author": {
        "name": "Author Name"
      },
      "source": "./plugins/plugin-name",
      "category": "development",
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "homepage": "https://github.com/user/repo",
      "repository": "https://github.com/user/repo",
      "license": "MIT"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 1.4 Plugin Source Types

**Relative Paths** (same repository):
```json
{"name": "my-plugin", "source": "./plugins/my-plugin"}
```

**GitHub Repositories**:
```json
{
  "name": "github-plugin",
  "source": {
    "source": "github",
    "repo": "owner/plugin-repo"
  }
}
```

**Git URLs**:
```json
{
  "name": "git-plugin",
  "source": {
    "source": "url",
    "url": "https://gitlab.com/team/plugin.git"
  }
}
```

### 1.5 Plugin Directory Structure

```
my-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # Plugin metadata

## Part 2: User Installation Methods

### 2.1 Standard Two-Step Installation

**Step 1: Add Marketplace**
```bash
/plugin marketplace add user-or-org/repo-name
```

Examples:
```bash
/plugin marketplace add jeremylongshore/claude-code-plugins
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
/plugin marketplace add https://gitlab.com/company/plugins.git
```

**Step 2: Install Plugin**
```bash
/plugin install plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

Examples:
```bash
/plugin install devops-automation-pack@claude-code-plugins-plus
/plugin install python-development@wshobson-agents
```

### 2.2 Interactive Plugin Menu

```bash
/plugin
```

This opens an interactive interface where users can:
- Browse available marketplaces
- View plugin descriptions
- Install/uninstall plugins
- Enable/disable plugins

### 2.3 Alternative Installation (npx)

Some marketplaces support streamlined installation:
```bash
npx claude-plugins install @user/marketplace/plugin-name
```

Example:
```bash
npx claude-plugins install @EveryInc/every-marketplace/compounding-engineering
```

### 2.4 Team/Organization Distribution

For automatic plugin installation across teams:

**Add to `.claude/settings.json`**:
```json
{
  "marketplaces": [
    "company-org/internal-plugins"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "security-standards@company-org",
    "coding-guidelines@company-org"
  ]
}
```

When team members trust the repository, plugins install automatically.

---

## Part 7: Alternative Distribution Methods (NOT Recommended)

### 7.1 Why NOT npm/PyPI?

**Official Position**:
- Claude Code plugins are NOT distributed via package managers
- Only the CLI itself (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) is on npm
- Plugins use Git-based distribution exclusively

**Why Git-Based is Better**:
- No publishing process required
- Instant updates via Git
- Version control built-in
- Easy collaboration
- No package manager overhead

### 7.2 Why NOT curl | bash Installers?

**Issues**:
- Security concerns (executing remote scripts)
- Not the official installation method
- Breaks update mechanism
- Harder to maintain
- Users expect `/plugin` commands

**Exception**: Only acceptable for installing Claude Code CLI itself (official installer)

### 7.3 Why NOT Manual Copy/Paste?

**Problems**:
- No update mechanism
- Error-prone
- Poor user experience
- Not discoverable
- Breaks plugin management

**When It's OK**: Only for development/testing before publication
