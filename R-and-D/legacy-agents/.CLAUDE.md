# Agents Folder Context

## Purpose & Responsibility
Contains the configurations for the multi-agent framework. This includes the central orchestrator and all available specialist agents.

## Key Files & Functions

### Orchestrator Agent
- `chief-architect.md`: The master orchestrator for complex, multi-agent projects. It analyzes goals, creates plans, and delegates tasks to specialists.

### Specialist Agents
- `specialists/docs-researcher.md`: A specialist agent responsible for researching documentation and answering technical questions.
- `specialists/implementation-planner.md`: A specialist agent that creates detailed, step-by-step implementation plans for coding tasks.
- `specialists/code-implementer.md`: A specialist agent that writes and modifies code based on a given plan. It includes a self-correction loop to test and debug its own work.

## Dependencies & Relationships
- **Uses**: All agents read from `../knowledge-core.md` to inform their actions.
- **Used by**: Core agent selection logic in `../core/agent-selection.md`
- **Integrates with**: Context management system for on-demand loading
- **Relates to**: Workflow patterns in `../core/workflow-patterns.md`

## Context Loading Strategy
- **Lazy Loading**: Agents loaded only when specific technical keywords trigger selection
- **Token Efficiency**: Each agent ~6-9k tokens, loaded individually rather than all at once
- **Smart Selection**: Context-driven selection based on current folder and task requirements

## Agent Selection Triggers
- **Folder-based**: Different agents triggered by working in specific directories
  - `api/`, `services/` → backend-specialist
  - `components/`, `ui/` → frontend-specialist  
  - `deploy/`, `infra/` → devops-engineer
  - `tests/`, `specs/` → qa-engineer

## Usage Patterns
1. **Single Agent Tasks**: Load one specialist for focused work (~8k tokens)
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Use sub-agent delegation for complex projects
3. **Context-Aware Selection**: Agent choice based on current folder context

## Performance Characteristics
- **Individual Load**: 6-9k tokens per agent
- **Selection Accuracy**: >90% with context-driven triggers
- **Memory Efficiency**: Load only needed agents vs traditional "load all" approach
