# Implementation Plan Summary

**Quick Reference for `/Users/amba/Code/claude-user-memory/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`**

---

## At a Glance

**Timeline**: 8 weeks (2 months)
**Effort**: 200 hours (0.5 FTE)
**Target Release**: Version 2.0.0

---

## The Big Picture

Transform claude-user-memory from a custom multi-agent system into an **official Claude Code plugin** that:
- Uses official Skills, hooks, and native agents
- Enforces workflow via deterministic hooks (not LLM-dependent)
- Auto-updates knowledge core (learns from every session)
- Self-corrects with 3 intelligent retries
- Installs with a single command

---

## Four Phases

### Phase 1: Official Format (Weeks 1-2)
Convert agents to official format, create Skills system, implement hooks.

**Key Deliverables**:
- 4 agents in official format (`.claude/agents/`)
- 4 Skills created (`.claude/skills/`)
- 8 hooks implemented (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Stop)
- Knowledge core auto-updates working

### Phase 2: Quality Gates (Weeks 3-4)
Build validation framework and enhance error recovery.

**Key Deliverables**:
- ResearchPack validator (score >= 80 required)
- Implementation Plan validator (score >= 85 required)
- Enhanced self-correction (3 retries with categorization)
- Circuit breaker pattern (prevents infinite loops)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Capabilities (Weeks 5-6)
Add advanced features and comprehensive documentation.

**Key Deliverables**:
- 4 slash commands (`/research`, `/plan`, `/implement`, `/workflow`)
- Metrics tracking system
- Pattern recognition skill
- 6 new comprehensive examples
- Complete documentation suite

### Phase 4: Distribution (Weeks 7-8)
Package as plugin and release.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Plugin manifest (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)
- Installation script (single-command install)
- Integration tests (80%+ coverage)
- Performance validation (>= 2x improvement)
- Version 2.0.0 release

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Installation | 15 min manual | < 5 min automated |
| Workflow Enforcement | 0% (LLM hope) | 100% (hooks) |
| Knowledge Learning | 0% manual | 80%+ automated |
| Self-Correction | 1 retry | 3 intelligent retries |
| Examples | 2 basic | 8+ comprehensive |
| Test Coverage | 0% | 80%+ |

---

## Key Architecture Changes

### Before (v1.x)
```
Custom agents → Manual workflow → Hope LLM follows rules
```

### After (v2.0)
```
Official agents + Skills → Hook-enforced gates → Auto-learning knowledge core
```

**New Components**:
- **Skills**: Model-invoked methodologies (HOW to research, plan, validate)
- **Hooks**: Deterministic quality gates (MUST pass to proceed)
- **Commands**: Slash commands for common workflows
- **Metrics**: Track and improve over time

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Top Risks**:
1. **Skills too new** (Oct 16 release) → Fallback to agent-only
2. **Hook limitations** → Move validation to prompts if needed
3. **Plugin distribution unclear** → Manual install backup

All risks have documented contingency plans.

## Quick Start (Once Released)

```bash
# Install plugin
claude plugin install claude-user-memory

# Run complete workflow
/workflow Add Redis caching to product service

# Or step-by-step
/research Redis caching patterns
/plan Redis integration
/implement Redis caching
```

## Week-by-Week Checklist

**Week 1**: Agent conversion, Skills creation
**Week 2**: Hooks implementation, knowledge core automation
**Week 3**: Validation framework (ResearchPack, Plan)
**Week 4**: Enhanced self-correction, circuit breaker
**Week 5**: Slash commands, metrics, pattern recognition
**Week 6**: Documentation, 6 new examples
**Week 7**: Plugin packaging, testing
**Week 8**: Beta testing, performance validation, release

---

## Key Principles (BRAHMA Constitution)

1. **Truth**: Use official Claude Code features only
2. **Verification**: Quality gates validate every phase
3. **Simplicity**: Don't reinvent what exists
4. **Reproducibility**: Hooks are deterministic, not LLM-dependent

---

## Resources Required

**Team**:
- 1 developer (20-25 hrs/week for 8 weeks)
- 3-5 beta testers (2-4 hrs each in Week 7)
- Optional: 1 technical reviewer (2-3 hrs/week)

**Tools**:
- Claude Code CLI v2.0.20+
- Git, Bash 4.0+
- 3 test environments (VMs/containers)
- GitHub Actions (free tier)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review** complete plan (`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`)
2. **Approve** strategic direction
3. **Set up** development environment
4. **Start** Phase 1, Week 1 tasks
5. **Track** progress against milestones
