## Update Global Memory

```bash

# Claude Code User Configuration - Orchestration System

## 🎯 Active Configuration

### Installed Agents
All agents in ~/.claude/agents/ are ready for use:
1. **orchestrator** - Manages complex multi-step workflows
2. **researcher** - Gathers documentation before implementation
3. **planner** - Creates structured plans with milestones
4. **implementer** - Generates production-ready code
5. **tester** - Creates comprehensive test suites
6. **reviewer** - Performs security and code audits
7. **memory** - Preserves knowledge across sessions

### Workflow Philosophy
```
Research → Plan → Implement → Test → Review → Remember
```

## 🔮 Automatic Agent Invocation

Claude Code automatically detects patterns and invokes appropriate agents:

### Complex Requests (→ orchestrator)
- "Build complete [system]"
- "Create entire [application]"
- Any request needing 3+ different capabilities

### Research Needs (→ researcher)
- "Find documentation for [technology]"
- "Research best practices"
- Before using any new library/API

### Planning Requirements (→ planner)
- "Create a plan for [project]"
- "Break down [complex task]"
- "Define milestones"

### Implementation (→ implementer)
- "Implement [feature]"
- "Fix [bug]"
- "Add [functionality]"

### Testing (→ tester)
- "Write tests for [code]"
- "Create test suite"
- "Ensure coverage"

### Review (→ reviewer)
- "Review [code]"
- "Check security"
- "Optimize performance"

### Documentation (→ memory)
- "Document [decision]"
- "Remember [pattern]"
- "Update conventions"

## 📚 Common Workflows

### Starting a New Project
1. Orchestrator activates
2. Researcher gathers relevant docs
3. Planner creates project structure
4. Memory initializes CLAUDE.md

### Adding a Feature
1. Researcher finds best practices
2. Planner creates implementation plan
3. Implementer generates code
4. Tester creates tests
5. Reviewer validates quality
6. Memory documents decisions

## 🛠️ Project Setup

When starting a new project, the following structure is automatically created:
```
project/
├── .claude/
│   └── agents/          # Project-specific agents (if needed)
├── docs/
│   ├── references/      # Documentation gathered by researcher
│   ├── ADR/            # Architecture decisions
│   └── patterns/       # Code patterns
├── tests/              # Test suites
└── CLAUDE.md           # Project memory
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Leverage Agent Expertise
- Let researcher gather docs BEFORE coding
- Use planner for complex tasks to avoid rework
- Always run tester after implementer
- Review critical code with reviewer
- Document decisions with memory

### Optimize Workflows
- Batch related tasks for efficiency
- Use orchestrator for multi-component features
- Trust agents to handle their specialties
- Update memory regularly for team knowledge

## 🔐 Security Defaults

- Never read or write .env files directly
- Secrets must use environment variables
- Input validation on all user data
- Security review for auth code
- Dependency scanning enabled
