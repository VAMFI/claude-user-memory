## 2. ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS & CONVENTIONS

### 2.1 Agent Frontmatter Format

All agents use YAML frontmatter:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear description with examples for auto-selection
color: unique-color  # purple, cyan, blue, etc.
---
```

### 2.2 Workflow Dependencies

**Critical Dependency Chain**:
```
docs-researcher → ResearchPack → 
    implementation-planner → Implementation Plan → 
        code-implementer → Code
```

**Core Rules**:
- Cannot plan without research (ResearchPack validation)
- Cannot implement without plan (Plan validation)
- This prevents coding from potentially outdated memory
- Enforced by precondition checks in agents

### 2.3 Output Formats

**ResearchPack Structure**:
- Task & Context (Goal, Stack, Library)
- Documentation Summary (Key APIs, Setup, Gotchas, Examples)
- Implementation Checklist (Files, Steps, Edge cases)
- Sources (Links with priorities)
- Open Questions (Decisions needed)

**Implementation Plan Structure**:
- Summary (2-3 lines)
- File Changes (specific actions per file)
- Implementation Steps (Action → Verification method)
- Test Plan (Commands, test cases, verification)
- Risks & Mitigations (Risk → Fix)
- Rollback Plan (Specific steps)

**Implementation Report Structure**:
- Progress Summary (Completed count, files modified, tests status)
- Changes Made (per-file summary)
- Commands Executed (with results)
- Issues & Next Steps
- Sources Used

### 2.4 Anti-Stagnation Patterns

All agents implement:
- **Progress Reporting**: Update every 30 seconds for long tasks
- **Time Limits**: Specific max times per phase (research: 2min, plan: 3min, implement: 5min)
- **Chunking**: Break large tasks into smaller chunks with reports
- **Error Status Prefix**: "❗ Issue:" for blockers, "⏳ Working on:" for long operations
- **Escape Hatches**: Defined fallback paths if blocked > timeout

### 2.5 Activation Mechanisms

**chief-architect triggers** (any of these):
- "Build complete [system]"
- "Create entire [application]"
- "Develop full [feature]"
- Tasks requiring 3+ capabilities
- Cross-functional requirements

**docs-researcher triggers**:
- "Research [topic]"
- Detecting new libraries/versions to be used
- Before any implementation work

**implementation-planner triggers**:
- "Plan [project]"
- Creating blueprints from research
- Complex architectural changes

**code-implementer triggers**:
- "Implement [feature]"
- Have both research and plan ready
- Direct specialist usage for focused work

---

## 3. STRENGTHS OF CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION

### 3.1 Workflow Integrity
✅ **Strict dependency enforcement** - Cannot skip research or planning
✅ **Reversibility** - All plans include rollback procedures
✅ **Version awareness** - docs-researcher detects package versions
✅ **Self-correction** - code-implementer runs tests and fixes once

### 3.2 User Communication

✅ **Agent learning** - All agents read knowledge-core before acting
✅ **Decision logging** - Chronological record of architectural decisions
✅ **Pattern documentation** - Established patterns prevent reinvention

### 3.4 Scalability
✅ **Modular specialist design** - Easy to add new agents
✅ **Lazy loading** - Only load needed agents
✅ **Token efficiency** - Each agent ~6-9k tokens

### 3.5 Documentation Quality
✅ **Comprehensive guides** - Philosophy, workflow, examples
✅ **Multiple installer options** - Choice based on needs
✅ **Contributing guidelines** - Clear expectations for enhancements
✅ **Archived history** - Deprecated files backed up, not deleted

## 4. GAPS & IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### 4.1 CRITICAL GAPS

#### Gap #1: No Explicit Error Recovery
**Issue**: Agents don't have structured error recovery beyond self-correction
**Impact**: If code-implementer's one retry fails, no fallback
**Recommendation**: Add circuit-breaker pattern with escalation to human
- [ ] Implement retry strategies (exponential backoff)
- [ ] Add human escalation with context
- [ ] Log all errors to knowledge-core

#### Gap #2: Knowledge Core Learning Not Automated
**Issue**: Currently template-only, no examples of updates
**Impact**: Agents don't actually learn across sessions
**Recommendation**: 
- [ ] Create initial knowledge-core with real project patterns
- [ ] Add auto-update capability (append-only log)
- [ ] Template for knowledge-core update suggestions
- [ ] Example: After auth implementation, auto-add patterns

#### Gap #3: No Multi-Project Isolation
**Issue**: Single knowledge-core at ~/.claude/ affects all projects
**Impact**: Local project patterns could contaminate global settings
**Recommendation**:
- [ ] Support project-local knowledge-core files
- [ ] Hierarchy: Enterprise → Project → User
- [ ] Merge precedence rules documented

#### Gap #4: No Integration with Latest Claude Code Features
**Issue**: Agents designed before latest Claude Code CLI features
**Impact**: Missing MCP support, latest hooks, native capabilities
**Recommendation**: Align with newest Claude Code APIs
- [ ] Document MCP server integration points
- [ ] Add SessionStart/PostToolUse hooks examples
- [ ] Leverage native TodoWrite for progress
- [ ] Use context7 directive for documentation

#### Gap #5: No Quality Metrics or Observability
**Issue**: No way to measure agent effectiveness
**Impact**: Can't identify which agents underperform
**Recommendation**:
- [ ] Track ResearchPack completeness score
- [ ] Measure Plan accuracy (match between plan and actual changes)
- [ ] Test pass rates on first attempt
- [ ] Time-to-completion metrics

### 4.2 IMPORTANT GAPS

#### Gap #6: Limited Example Coverage
**Issue**: Only 2 examples (Redis caching, direct specialist usage)
**Impact**: Users unclear how to use for different scenarios
**Recommendation**:
- [ ] Authentication system example (JWT/OAuth)
- [ ] Database migration example
- [ ] Performance optimization example
- [ ] API versioning example
- [ ] Monorepo refactoring example
- [ ] Dependency update example

#### Gap #7: No Built-in Validation Framework
**Issue**: ResearchPacks and Plans validated manually
**Impact**: No consistent quality thresholds
**Recommendation**:
- [ ] Checklist validator for ResearchPack completeness
- [ ] Plan validator (all files covered, test plan present, etc.)
- [ ] Implementation validator (all changes from plan executed)
- [ ] Quality gates that block proceeding without pass

#### Gap #8: Limited Technology Coverage
**Issue**: Agents generic but not tested with diverse stacks
**Impact**: May fail with specialized frameworks
**Recommendation**:
- [ ] Document supported technologies
- [ ] Add specialized sub-agents for: Python/Django, Go, Rust, C#/.NET
- [ ] Test framework for each tech stack
- [ ] Community contribution process for new stacks

#### Gap #9: No Context Window Optimization
**Issue**: Agents could be more token-efficient
**Impact**: Slower execution, higher costs
**Recommendation**:
- [ ] Add context compression (summarize old decisions)
- [ ] Lazy-load sub-sections of knowledge-core
- [ ] Streaming output for long tasks
- [ ] Implement semantic chunking

#### Gap #10: No Parallelization Strategy
**Issue**: Workflow is sequential by default
**Impact**: Chief-architect can't run independent tasks concurrently
**Recommendation**:
- [ ] Identify independent tasks in decomposition
- [ ] Implement parallel Task invocations
- [ ] Coordination protocol for merge conflicts
- [ ] Dependency graph visualization

### 4.3 ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

#### Opportunity #1: Advanced Agent Specialization
**Potential**: Add new specialist agents for specific concerns
- Security-focused agent (SAST, dependency scanning)
- Performance agent (profiling, optimization)
- Documentation agent (API docs, ADR creation)
- Testing specialist (test design, coverage analysis)

#### Opportunity #2: Multi-LLM Support
**Potential**: Allow different Claude models for different tasks
- GPT-4 for complex architecture decisions
- Claude 3 Haiku for simple tasks (cost optimization)
- Specialized models for specific domains

#### Opportunity #3: Interactive Planning Mode
**Potential**: Allow user feedback during planning
- Show draft plans with checkpoints
- User can approve, modify, or reject steps
- Agents can ask clarifying questions mid-task

#### Opportunity #4: Integration with Development Workflow
**Potential**: Connect to Git, CI/CD, issue tracking
- Read from GitHub issues for task context
- Auto-create PRs from implementations
- Comment on PRs with agent analysis
- Trigger workflows from Jira/Linear

#### Opportunity #5: Knowledge Graph Enhancement
**Potential**: Move from markdown to structured graph
- Relationships between patterns
- Semantic search for patterns
- Conflict detection between decisions
- Recommendation engine for similar problems

## 7. ALIGNMENT WITH BRAHMA CONSTITUTION

From the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (UNIFIED BRAHMA ORCHESTRATION V2.0):

### Current Alignment

✅ **Multi-agent architecture** - Implements 4-agent system (orchestrator + 3 specialists)
✅ **Clear specialization** - Each agent has well-defined domain
✅ **Quality gates** - Dependency enforcement between phases
✅ **Knowledge persistence** - knowledge-core.md provides memory
✅ **Constitution principle** - Project CLAUDE.md enforces strict workflow
✅ **Build-Fix-Serve philosophy** - Could extend to all three

### Gaps vs BRAHMA System

❌ **Incomplete specialization** - BRAHMA has 18 agents, this has 4
❌ **No /build /fix /serve commands** - Missing command interface
❌ **No MCP integration** - Not leveraging Model Context Protocol
❌ **No native hook system** - Could use Claude Code's SessionStart, PostToolUse
❌ **No constitutional enforcement** - Constitution pattern not implemented
❌ **No clarify-plan-analyze pattern** - Missing clarification phase

### Recommendations for BRAHMA Alignment

**Option A: Extend This Project**
- Add 14 more specialist agents matching BRAHMA
- Implement /build, /fix, /serve commands
- Add constitutional system
- Implement clarify-analyze phases

**Option B: Keep Separate But Compatible**
- This project: 3-phase workflow (research-plan-implement)
- BRAHMA: 18-agent system with broader scope
- Use this as building block for larger system
- Document integration points
